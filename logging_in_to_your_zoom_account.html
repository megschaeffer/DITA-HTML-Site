        <div class="p">For security purposes, Zoom logs you out after 120 minutes of inactivity. However, many
            class meetings now require authentication with your University account to prevent
            disruptions, so it is important to know how to login to your UMN account. There are
            three main ways to login to your UMN Zoom account:<ul class="ul" id="logging_in_to_your_zoom_account__ul_nwy_d4b_dpb">
